# Parallel-Programming

Overview:

Covers basic concepts (synchronization, memory consistency, locality, speedup,
etc). Programming models (data-parallel, shared-memory, and message-passing). Languages and tools. Perfor-
mance analysis. Implementation of parallel algorithms

Objectives

1. Main concepts related to parallel programming, including synchronization, memory consistency,
locality, and speed-up
2. Different parallel programming models, including data-parallel, task-parallel, shared-memory,
message-passing, and PGAS (partitioned-global-address-space)
3. Parallel algorithms for sorting and numerical computation
4. Thread-based shared-memory parallel programs
5. Explicit message-passing programs
6. Parallel programs using high-level language constructs
7. Measure and analyze performance of parallel programs
